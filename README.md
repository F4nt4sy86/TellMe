# TellMe
Share, edit and manage shoppinglists between people

# The idea
This Androidapp will help you and your friends/familymembers/coworkers/whatever to manage shoppinglists. Lets say you live in a dorm or with your family / partner: So youre heading to the store to get something. Your Girlfriend / whoever also needs something, but she / he cant tell you right now! TellMe let them tell you what they need when they think about it. Imagine that your Girlfriend thought about about the broken lightbulb in the bathroom while dreaming at work (wich she ofc. never does). After the meeting she can immediately put lightbulb on the shared shoppinglist! So whoever gets into a store first can just look up the shared shoppinglist and boom. Noones ever mad again because 'someone' 'forgot to ask' if anyone needs anything else.
